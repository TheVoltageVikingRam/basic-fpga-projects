Half Adder Circuit on Digilent Arty S7-25

This project demonstrates the implementation of a half adder circuit on the Digilent Arty S7-25 FPGA board using Verilog HDL.

Project Overview:

A half adder is a basic digital circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers and produces two outputs: the sum and carry.

Inputs: A, B

Outputs: Sum, Carry

Board Used:
FPGA Board: Digilent Arty S7-25

HDL: Verilog
