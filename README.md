# basic-fpga-projects

The various projects under this category of basic FPGA projects are mostly implemented on the Digilent Arty S7-25 board.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Not all designs in this repository are directly synthesizable or implementable on FPGA.  
Some are **pure Verilog designs intended for functional simulation only**.  

üëâ For those simulation-focused designs (in Cadence Xcelium waveforms), please refer to the following repository:
